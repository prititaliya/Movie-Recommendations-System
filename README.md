# Movie-Recommendations-System

Welcome to the Movie Recommendation System, a Python-based project leveraging Collaborative Filtering to provide personalized movie suggestions. Built with Pandas, NumPy, and Pearson Correlation, this project utilizes the MovieLens Dataset to demonstrate effective recommendation strategies.


üìö Project Overview

This recommendation system uses Collaborative Filtering to suggest movies based on user preferences and similarities between movie ratings. The system filters popular movies, creates a user-movie matrix, and calculates correlations to recommend movies that align with user interests.

Core Functionalities:
	‚Ä¢	Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare data from the MovieLens dataset.
	‚Ä¢	Filtering Popular Movies: Focus on movies with significant user engagement.
	‚Ä¢	User-Movie Pivot Table: Build a user-movie rating matrix.
	‚Ä¢	Correlation-Based Recommendations: Calculate movie similarities using Pearson Correlation.
	‚Ä¢	Personalized Suggestions: Recommend movies similar to user-selected favorites.

 üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
	‚Ä¢	Python: Core programming language.
	‚Ä¢	Pandas: Data preprocessing and matrix manipulation.
	‚Ä¢	NumPy: Numerical computations.
	‚Ä¢	Pearson Correlation: Measure similarity between movies.
	‚Ä¢	Jupyter Notebook/VS Code: Development and visualization environment.

 üìä Dataset Details
	‚Ä¢	Dataset Source: MovieLens Dataset
	‚Ä¢	Files Used:
	‚Ä¢	movies.csv: Movie details (ID, title, genres)
	‚Ä¢	ratings.csv: User ratings (userId, movieId, rating, timestamp)
